                         faced strong criticisms from the UK data watchdog. It made the claim earlier that the 
                         number of homeless people had more than halved since 2003. Using official data, a graph about the number of 
                         homeless people from 2003 to 2015 is as follows:
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <script src="https://infograph.venngage.com/js/embed/v1/embed.js" data-vg-id="225599" data-title="Homeless people in the UK" data-w="640" data-h="640"></script>
                </div>
            </div>
        
            
                    <p class="text-muted">The total number of homeless people did decrease (see this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/life.hkbu.edu.hk/spreadsheets/d/1Xo8r2-jFH5jFgltnri_r6o5kh-6T8emaZr1QdgAOmRs/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to look at the raw data).
                    But that's just part of the statistics. This claim was found to gloss over the fact that this was only the case under a narrow definition of homelessness; to include only those who authorities are obliged to help. The number did not take into account homeless people who were given assistance under other schemes. </p>
           <br>
                    <p class="text-muted">Homelessness is recorded differently in each nation and because many homeless people do not show up in official statistics at all. To be legally defined as homeless you must either lack a secure place in which you are entitled to live or not reasonably be able to stay in your current accommodation. 
                        <br> <br>However, in order for your local authority to have a duty to find you housing, there are further strict criteria that you have to meet. The housing a local authority provides to households who meet these criteria, mainly families with children, may initially be temporary accommodation.</p>
       <br>
                    </span>
                 
                    <p class="text-muted">The vast majority of single homeless people who are not entitled to housing, as well as those who, for a variety of reasons do not even apply for homelessness assistance, end up surviving out of sight.</p>

                    <img src="img/Screen Shot 2017-02-24 at 12.11.52 PM.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:700px;height:966pxx;">

                <br>
                <p class="text-muted">Many homeless people stay in hostels and there are just over 38,500 be spaces in hostels for single homeless people in England but there are other ways to get by. This might mean staying in squats or B&Bs, in overcrowded accommodation or â€˜concealed' housing, such as the floors or sofas of friends and family.
                        <br> <br>If you do not qualify for local authority housing assistance, if you are sleeping rough, staying in a hostel, a squat or some other form of unsatisfactory or insecure accommodation, then you are one of the countless thousands of hidden homeless people.
                        <br>
                        From the graph above, it shows that the number of people who go rough sleeping has in fact increased over the years. So to say that the number of homeless people decreases, when in fact so many 
                        of them go unrecorded, is an understatement.
